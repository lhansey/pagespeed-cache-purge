# pagespeed-cache-purge
A WordPress Plugin to Flush the mod_pagespeed Cache

Initial mock-up of a WordPress plug-in to purge the mod_pagespeed cache.  
Have not seen one out there and have run into issues with pagespeed heavily caching.
This plug-in relies heavily on other server-side configurations at this time.  Use at your own risk.
